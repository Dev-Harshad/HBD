    <p id="text">Today is you specialest day - YOUR BIRTHDAY !!! 😊. <br>
        Recently, we had gone to EBC where it was very exciting because of youu and that has also been ticked from your bucket list. <br>
        On that trip you helped me aloootttt and gave me many tips and even experiences along with pinch of learning & life lessons ❤️ <br>
        Since the trip I feel that you are much more relaxed now which you should be but you still did not stop working hard and have free time😔. <br>
        Also in april you had gone to Ujjain which i hope you enjoyed alot and we also went to sooooo many places in the past 😂. <br>
        May this year bring you as much happiness and joy as you've brought to me!  <br>
        Here’s to celebrating you today and always. The whole BIRADAR FAMILY wishes you a very birthday and a blessed life ahead😊🥳!
